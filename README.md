Feature Engineering for Automatic Seizure Type Detection (Work In Progress)
One of the essential aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of the epilepsy by using electroencephalograms (EEGs) is the necessity of a case-specific analysis, which avoids a merely empirical approach based on trial and error in favor of a more systematic one. The detection of the specific type of the seizure in each epileptic patient can be helpful and can offer the possibility of receiving a personalized therapy. The majority of the machine learning algorithms for the seizure detection using EEG signal are exclusively designed to distinguish between the pre-ictal and the inter-ictal signal. This project aims to design a multi-class predictor for the classification of EEG signal
